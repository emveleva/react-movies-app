Hi, welcome to the **NextMovie** React app documentation!
To start the app, enter both folders and use the **npm start** command in both. 

The app is a movie website, something like Goodreads, but well, not for books. The idea is to add more and more movies and make it useful for when you are wondering what to watch or whether you are have already watched something. Or, you want to want a movie but it's not released yet and you don't want to forget.
